database/ → Handles the connection to the database, creates sessions, and provides the base that models use. Essentially, it’s the “bridge” between your app and the DB.

models/ → Contains classes that represent database tables. Each class defines the fields and data types of a table.

schemas/ → Defines how incoming and outgoing data is validated and structured. Useful to ensure that received data is correct and the output has a consistent format.

controllers/ → Contains the business logic. For example, how to create, read, update, or delete records (CRUD), or any more complex operations involving multiple models.

routes/ → Defines the API endpoints, the URLs, and which HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) executes each action. It basically connects the controller logic with external requests.
